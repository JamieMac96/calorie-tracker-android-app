#Calorie Tracker Android App

##Description:
This is a repo for my calorie tracking android application. The purpose of the app is to allow users track their daily calorie intake as and track their bodyweightweight over time.

##Functionality:
* Sign up: Users sign up using an email and password.
* Login
* Food diary: The main activity of the app displays a food diary containing the food that the user has eaten that day. Here we display the name, the protein, carb and fat content of the
  food as well as the total calories in the food.
